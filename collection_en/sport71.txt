Prime Defender is being targeted at next month's Golden Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot following his surprise win at York.

Barry Hills' six-year-old finally picked up a Group race win at the 20th attempt in the Duke of York Stakes last week, defying odds of 20-1.

And connections are hopeful the entire will continue to perform with credit at the highest level.

"He's come out of the York race bouncing," said Hills' son and assistant Charlie.

"It was a bit of a surprise, but we always thought he was Group class but it's taken a long time for him to prove it.

"Everything went right for him in the race and I suppose if he held that form in the Golden Jubilee he'd be there or thereabouts.

"With sprinters they always seem to take their turn to win these races. He's always run well back to back."
