Houston Texans linebacker Brian Cushing, last season's defensive rookie of the year, has been handed a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances.

Cushing, 23, is allowed to practice with the Texans and play in pre-season matches but will miss the regular season fixtures against the Indianapolis Colts (Sep 12), Washington Redskins (Sep 19), Dallas Cowboys (Sep 26) and Oakland Raiders (Oct 3).

He is eligible to return on October 10 when the Texans entertain the New York Giants at Reliant Stadium.

"Brian is a productive member of our team and this is a significant loss, but we have to be prepared to win without him," read a statement from Houston general manager Rick Smith on the team's official website.

Cushing, the 15th overall selection in the 2009 draft, made 133 tackles, four sacks and four interceptions last season.
