Tweddle: Serene performances

Great Britain's women emulated the men to claim a team silver medal at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Birmingham on Saturday.

World champion Beth Tweddle delivered serene performances on the uneven bars and floor to help Becky Downie, Nicole Hibbert, Niamh Rippin and Jocelyn Hunt to a total of 168.275 points at the National Indoor Arena.

The points-haul was enough to help the women emulate the men's team with a first major championships podium place to rapturous acclaim from the partisan crowd.

Russia took gold with 169.700 while defending champions Romania were third.

Tweddle paid tribute to her team-mates - 18-year-old Downie and three debutants, 16-year-old Rippin and 15-year-olds Hibbert and Hunt.
Work

"They've done all the work to be up there on the podium just as much as I have," she said.

Tweddle, who made her international debut in 2001, has won European, Commonwealth and world titles, but was thrilled to stand on the podium alongside her young team-mates.

She added: "It means so much more because it was for the team and not just myself.

"Coming into these championships I did not think we would be up there in the top three. I knew we had the potential to be up there in the top six and make the team final, but they've outdone my expectations."

Britain's men won team silver on the way to a haul of one gold - for Daniel Keatings in the pommel horse - two silvers and a bronze last weekend.
