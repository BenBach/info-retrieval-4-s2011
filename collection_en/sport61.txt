Matthew Lloyd followed in the footsteps of Jérôme Pineau by claiming the second breakaway victory in as many stages on day six of the Giro d'Italia.

The Australian Omega Pharma-Lotto rider forged ahead early on with Rubens Bertogliati (Androni Giocattoli), but dropped his accomplice on the final climb of the day before battling on to the finish line one minute and six seconds ahead of the Italian.

And the fact that Lloyd had claimed maximum points on the day's three classified climbs also ensured he took over the lead in the mountains classification.

There was no change at the top of the overall standings, meaning Vincenzo Nibali retained his 13-second advantage over Liquigas team-mate Ivan Basso.

Lloyd and Bertogliati's advantage had earlier reached a maximum of five and a half minutes as they reached the base of the day's first major climb up the Passo del Brattello.

The duo continued to work well together and still had almost three minutes on the field when Evgueni Petrov (Katusha), Johann Tschopp (Bbox-Bouygues) and Cayetano Sarmiento (Acqua & Sapone) joined forces to try and haul them back with around 25km to go.

The day's exertions finally began to take their toll on Bertogliati, who was unable to keep the pace with Lloyd on the Bedizzano, but even he was able to hang on doggedly at the line as the bunch once again left it too late to challenge for top honours.

Lampre's Danilo Hondo completed the podium places, nine seconds behind Bertogliati, after outsprinting Manuel Belletti (Colnago-CSF) and Filippo Pozzato (Katusha) in the closing stages.
