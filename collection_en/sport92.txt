Great Britain missed out on a second successive World Championship bronze medal as they were defeated 2-1 by Poland in Slovenia.

Britain secured third place on the podium in Poland 12 months ago, their first medal for eight years, and were on course for another bronze until they were denied on the final day of their Division One Group B campaign.

Cardiff Devils forward Phil Hill put GB ahead in the 18th minute, but the teams were all square going into the final session after Jaroslaw Rzeszutko fired home for Poland.

The Poles, who outshot the Brits 43-20, then netted the winner with six minutes remaining thanks to Mikolaj Lopuski.

And even after pulling netminder Stephen Murphy in a bid to equalise, GB could not force overtime.
