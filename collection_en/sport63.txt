The Giro d'Italia saw its third pink jersey holder emerge in as many days after the Dutch road obstacles and gusting crosswinds caused havoc on stage three.

The morning leader, Cadel Evans (BMC Racing), had been right at the front of the peloton with around 10 kilometres to go, but got caught up in a crash involving four Team Sky riders - among them stage one winner Bradley Wiggins - and ended the day 43 seconds adrift of new jersey holder Alexandre Vinokourov (Astana).

Shortly before Vinokourov had crossed the line in 10th position, Quick-Step's Wouter Weylandt had claimed the stage victory by outsprinting Graeme Brown (Rabobank) and Robert Förster (Milram) in a flat-out finish along the streets of Middelburg.
Calm before the storm

Clear and calm conditions in Amsterdam at the start of the day had belied what was to come as Jérôme Pineau (Quick-Step), Olivier Kaisen (Omega Pharma-Lotto) and Tom Stamsnijder (Rabobank) formed an early breakaway.

That trio temporarily built a lead of six minutes on the bunch but had been hauled back by the time the riders reached the coastline at Ouddorp.

From then on the winds picked up considerably and splintered the peloton into several groups, with those caught towards the back of the field battling frantically to stay in touch.

Garmin's Christian Vande Velde was one high-profile casualty to emerge from that blustery section and was forced to quit the race entirely after picking up a serious collarbone injury in one of several crashes along the seafront.

Team Sky had looked out of danger at the very head of the field, but their hopes of a stage win came to an abrupt end when Wiggins and three of his team-mates were sent tumbling on a tight left-hand bend.

Evans was not as seriously affected as his rivals and battled his way back into the second group before the finish line, but his efforts to retain the jersey ultimately proved fruitless with Vinokourov benefiting greatly from his own trouble-free ride.
