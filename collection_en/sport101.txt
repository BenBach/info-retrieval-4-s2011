Kebede: Ended Kenya's dominance

Ethiopa's Tsegaye Kebede produced a superb run to win the Virgin London Marathon and break Kenya's six-year dominance in the men's race.

Kebede clocked an unofficial time of 2 hours, 5 minutes and 18 seconds to go one better than his second-placed finish 12 months ago.

The Olympic bronze-medallist broke clear after 20 miles and finished well ahead of Kenya's world silver-medallist Emmanuel Mutai. Jaouad Gharib of Morocco took third place.

Meanwhile, Russian Liliya Shobukhova followed up her victory in the Chicago Marathon by claiming the London title.

The European 5000 metres track record holder used her finishing speed to see off compatriot Inga Abitova, with Ethiopia's Asselefech Mergia third.

Shobukhova's success means she is the first Russian woman to win the race. She was awarded an unofficial time of two hours and 22 minutes.

Defending champion Irina Mikitenko, who was looking to equal felow German Katrin Dorre's three successive victories, was forced to quit due tp an injury to her left foot.

Britain's Mara Yamauchi, whose 6,500-mile journey from her training base in New Mexico took six days due to the problems with air travel caused by the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud, fell off the pace around the halfway stage.
