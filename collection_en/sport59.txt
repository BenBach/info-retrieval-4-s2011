Cadel Evans produced a brilliant performance to win a brutal seventh stage of the Giro d'Italia on Saturday.

The Australian world road race champion dug deepest of all during the 222km trek from Carrara to Montalcino, a stage which was made even tougher by driving rain and two sections of strade bianche, white-gravelled roads which had been turned into mud tracks.

The BMC Racing rider had been to the fore throughout, attacking first with Alexandre Vinokourov (Astana) 16km from the finish on the second strade bianche and then again with 9km remaining.

The second move proved decisive and going under the flamme rouge there were only four other riders with him - Vinokourov, David Arroyo (Caisse d'Epargne), Damiano Cunego (Lampre) and Marco Pinotti (HTC-Columbia).

Evans looked vulnerable at the head of affairs but as the others lined up to pounce he simply kicked again on the uphill finish to ride them into submission.

Cunego and Vinokourov took second and third respectively, with the Astana man taking over at the top of the overall standings.

Vinokourov leads the general classification by one minute and 12 seconds from Evans, with Britain's David Millar (Garmin-Transitions) a further 17 seconds behind in third.

Italian Dario Cioni led home Team Sky in 24th position on the stage and he's 25th overall, 7:21 back.
Testing times

The standings were blown apart by the testing conditions and Vincenzo Nibali (Liqugas), the previous holder of the leader's pink jersey, did well to limit his losses to 1:33 by battling back superbly following a crash on a slick right-hand bend 34km from the finish.

The stage had started with a fast opening section as 52.5km were covered in the first hour and after 80km Nicki Sorensen (Saxo Bank) and Rick Flens (Rabobank) broke clear.

That attack lasted almost exactly 100km at which point Team Sky's Cioni surged into a short-lived lead.

But it was the sections of strade bianche - usually dusty white-gravelled roads - which defined one of the toughest stages in recent Grand Tour history.

The riders finished exhausted and caked in mud but there's unlikely to be any let up as Sunday's eighth stage culminates with a 21km-climb up Monte Terminillo.
