Defenceman Brian Lee has pledged his loyalty to Elite League champions Coventry Blaze for a second year.

The 25-year-old American was key to Blaze's silverware success this season and was crowned players' player of the year, as well as being voted the defenceman and player of the year by the team's supporters.

"I'm really excited, especially after the type of year we've had here, I'm excited to start next season," Lee told Coventry's official website.

"I'm looking forward to playing with the returning guys and defending the title in Coventry."

Lee also revealed he is enjoying his stint with the four-time champions after arriving at the Skydome last year from the Briancon Diables Rouges of the French Elite League.

"I've been treated really well at Coventry," added Lee. "The fans are outstanding and it's a real pleasure to play in front of such brilliant fans."
