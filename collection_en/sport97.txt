Tweddle: Two golds on home soil

Britain's Beth Tweddle delighted the home crowd at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Birmingham by winning two gold medals.

Having triumphed in the uneven bars and on the floor in Milan last year, the 25-year-old successfully defended both titles at the National Indoor Arena.

Tweddle produced a flawless display during her uneven bars routine to earn a score of 15.875 and clinch a third European crown on the apparatus.

She then managed a 14.825 score on the floor, the same event in which she is world champion, to claim her second gold medal in under an hour.

Tweddle's individual double comes after she helped Great Britain take silver in the team event on Saturday.
Emotional rollercoaster

"It's been an emotional rollercoaster," Tweddle said afterwards. "Last night we had the team silver and it's hard to bring yourself down and focus on today.

"I just had to keep my head down, do exactly what I've been doing in the gym and luckily I think with the experience I was able to bring on board, I was able to come out today and do the job.

"Now I'll go back to the hotel with the team and celebrate the team's success as well as my own."

Meanwhile, Britain's Niamh Rippin was equal sixth with a score of 13.400 on the floor. Team-mate Nicole Hibbert was eighth and last in the vault final.
