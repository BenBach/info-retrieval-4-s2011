Ronaldinho has conceded that he is not sure whether he will still be at AC Milan next season.

The Brazilian finished the season in style on Saturday with two goals to help Milan beat Juventus 3-0 at the San Siro.

He has another 12 months left on his contract but speculation has surfaced over what the future might hold for the former World Player of the Year.

Asked if he was certain he would be at Milan next season, Ronaldinho told Sky TV: "I don't know."

The fact that compatriot Leonardo is on his way out of the club after just one season as manager has fuelled rumours that Ronaldinho might not want to stay.

Ronaldinho admits that he has enjoyed working under Leonardo, saying: "It has been beautiful working with him.

"He is a friend and I want to see him happy, but we must respect his decision."
Brazil snub

Ronaldinho's good form this season has not been enough to earn a place in the provisional Brazil squad for the World Cup.

However, he insists there is no bitterness towards Dunga for the snub.

"My response was here on the pitch, but if he doesn't pick me for the national team it's his choice and I respect that," he said.

"I've done many good things this season and I don't want to compare myself to others to see if I've done much more or much less, I'm calm."
