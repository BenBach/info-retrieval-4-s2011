Danny Williams will defend his British title for the final time against Derek Chisora on May 15 after Sam Sexton was forced to pull out.

Chisora was lined up to fight veteran Williams in February after Sexton withdrew for the first time with a hand injury, but the champion ducked out citing personal problems.

However, the undefeated Chisora now gets a second chance after Commonwealth champion Sexton pulled out again, this time because his mother is seriously ill.

Williams, a former heavyweight title contender now 36, admitted he was 'shot' after losing in the first round of Sky Sports' Prizefighter last year.

However, he subsequently announced that he will defend his British title for one more time rather than give it up.

Sexton's team released the following statement regarding the fighter's situation.

"Sam Sexton's mother was admitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital with an aneurysm to her head in critical condition. Having undergone extensive tests she is now awaiting the possibility of a rare life saving operation.

"Sam has not left his mother's bedside throughout her ordeal has been unable to continue his training for the past week, and it seems potentially for the foreseeable future, until his mother has hopefully had her operation and is out of danger.

"Being in the most important period of his training and after extensive discussion with his trainer it was decided that Sam was not in a fit state of mind for any fight, let alone a championship fight."
