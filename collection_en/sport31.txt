Kevin Mitchell has taken a pop at Amir Khan ahead of his clash with Michael Katsidis for the interim WBO lightweight title on May 15.

Mitchell says Khan is taking the 'easy option' by defending his WBA title against the light-punching Paulie Malignaggi, rather than going for a massive domestic dust-up with the East Londoner.

But Mitchell, who is unbeaten in 31 fights, intends to raise his profile with a devastating victory over the teak-tough Aussie at Upton Park on Saturday week.

And he hopes the WBO strap will act as a potent bargaining tool to the Olympic silver medallist, who is trying to make his name stateside.

"The only time I'd get to meet Khan is if he got beaten and wanted to up his profile," said the 25-year-old from Dagenham.

"If Khan gets beaten again then no one will want to know him. They'll know he's not the real thing.

"It could happen but if he'd fancied the fight it would have been on by now.

"He's fighting Malignaggi next - that says it all. Malignaggi is made for him because he doesn't punch.

"Khan's brilliant but is vulnerable in certain areas. Anyone who can catch him has got a half decent chance.

"I've been told Khan is getting US$1.1million for the fight - that's crazy money because there's no risk involved.

"I've definitely got a much harder fight and that shows what I'm about and that I've got the nerve to pick the tough fights.

"I'm getting a tuppence compared to him and I've got a harder fight in front of me.

"The money will come to me down the line but I'm doing it the hard way, that's what I'm about."
