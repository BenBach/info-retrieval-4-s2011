WWE's Apex Predator Randy Orton will go head-to-head against Edge at the upcoming pay-per-view event Over The Limit.

The Superstars, who were once a tag team force known as Team Rated-RKO will clash inside the ring at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan on Sunday, May 23.

Tensions between Orton and The Rated-R Superstar hit boiling point this past Monday Night as RAW's latest acquisition looked to establish himself as the dominating force on WWE's top brand. But The Viper was not about to slide down the food chain.

Making an appearance on Edge's highly controversial talk show "The Cutting Edge", an enraged Orton silenced the former SmackDown Superstar, delivering an RKO not only to Edge, but also to this week's RAW special guest host Wayne Brady.

What will happen when Orton goes up against his former tag-team partner Edge? Find out at WWE Over the Limit, on the night of Sunday May 23, exclusively LIVE on Sky Box Office HD.
