Semenya: Resolution expected

IAAF president Lamine Diack has stated that the gender row surrounding Caster Semenya will be resolved by the end of June.

The South African has not raced since winning the 800 metres gold medal at last year's World Championships.

The results of tests to determine the athlete's gender were initially expected in November but the case has not yet been concluded.

Diack says he cannot fully explain the current situation but is confident that a solution is close.

"This issue must be a confidential one. We had this kind of problem but it never got out," he said.

"It's the first time that it got open. My job was in the end to make it confidential and I think we are on the way to finding the solution.
Solution

"In the coming weeks we will tell you: 'This is the solution'. It will not take longer than until the end of June.

"I cannot elaborate on that. This girl was in a very difficult position. It was very difficult for everyone."

Speaking ahead of Friday night's inaugural IAAF Diamond League meeting in Doha, Diack also confirmed he would be standing for re-election next year.

"The people are thinking that we have to find someone to rebuild our democracy," the 76-year-old added.

"And 90 per cent of the people are saying: 'Diack is the guy for that'. That's the situation.

"If all the country say: 'Lamine, there is the mission, you have to rebuild for four years', I will be under an obligation to say: 'Look for a successor'."
