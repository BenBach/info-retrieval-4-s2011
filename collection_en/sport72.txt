Lookin at Lucky held off the challenge of First Dude to triumph in the 135th running of the Preakness Stakes.

The Bob Baffert charge moved around the outside in the final turn before surging ahead in the home-stretch, covering the 1 3/16-mile race in 1 minute 55.47 seconds.

First Dude finished three-quarters of a length behind the winner, with Jackson Bend coming in third and Yawanna Twist in fourth.

Any hopes of a first Triple Crown winner since 1978 were killed off as Kentucky Derby winner Super Saver came home a disappointing eighth.

Baffert opted to drop jockey Garret Gomez for Martin Garcia after a poor showing in the Kentucky Derby and his decision paid-off as he secured a fifth victory in the Preakness.
Warrior

"This horse has so much heart. He's a warrior," the trainer said. "I didn't feel confident until I saw those colours and him cruising. Turning for home I just thought: 'Please nobody run me down'."

The trainer also paid tribute to Garcia, a jockey selection that was doubted by some due to the 25-year-old's lack of experience.

He added: "He came out to ride. He's so young. He doesn't realise the importance of this race."

Super Saver jockey Calvin Borel, whose ride went off joint favourite with the eventual winner, downplayed the failure of his horse.

"When I asked him (to charge), he just kind of folded up. It happens," he said. "Perfect trip. I wouldn't have changed it for nothing in the world. He just come up empty."
