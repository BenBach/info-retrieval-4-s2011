Kim Clijsters has withdrawn from the French Open due to an ankle injury.

The Belgian has taken the decision to miss Roland Garros after a CT scan revealed that fluid is still building up around her ankle.

Her announcement not only means she will miss out on playing in Paris, where she is a two-time finalist, but also that her clay court season is now over.

The 26-year-old, who has been replaced in the main draw by Canada's Stephanie Dubois, will next play at Eastbourne, which begins on June 14, in preparation for Wimbledon.

"I will continue my recovery to be totally up for the season on grass," Clijsters said on her official website, www.kimclijsters.be.

"It's really a shame to give up on Roland Garros. Paris is so close I always feel a little at home. And that's where I played my first grand slam final.

"But the foot pain forces me to throw in the towel."

Clijsters has not entered the French Open since reaching the semi-finals in 2006. She returned to the WTA Tour in 2009 after a two-year retirement.

Meanwhile, Nikolay Davydenko has also pulled out for the men's event with a sore left wrist.

The Russian, who reached the last four in the French capital in 2005 and then again in 2007, follows Juan Martin del Potro, Tommy Haas, Igor Andreev and James Blake in withdrawing from the tournament.
