Tom Chilton won one race but was disqualified after winning another on an eventful day in the British Touring Car Championship at Brands Hatch.

Chilton stormed to victory in the first race in round three and then following up in the second, only to be demoted when his Aon Ford Focus failed a mandatory technical check.

Chilton revelled in the heavy rain and spray in the first race to claim his first Ford win in a decade and the 25-year-old's first success in two years.

His margin was emphatic, beating Honda Racing Team's Gordon Shedden by more than five seconds, with team-mate Tom Onslow-Cole third.

"I felt I was doing quite well in my swimming trunks and goggles out there," he said.

"The Focus is the best car I've ever driven in the wet. It did everything I asked. We have got it set up perfectly.

"A first win for LPG, the first for Ford since 2000, two Toms on the podium - just a great result for all the people in our team."

Chilton's day was soured when he was stripped of the second race, after again dominating, although the blow was softened for his team with Onslow-Cole moved to the top of the podium ahead of Shedden and Alex MacDowall.

Mat Jackson then won the day's final race on a drying track, holding off the fast-finishing Matt Neal, whose efforts saw him join Jason Plato at the top of the driver's standings.

Jackson's success was made even more laudable when it emerged he had driven the final two laps with a slow puncture.

Steven Kane was third after he gave up second to his team-mate Neal.
