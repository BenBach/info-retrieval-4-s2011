Keatings: Struck gold

British ace Daniel Keatings claimed pommel horse gold at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Birmingham on Sunday.

The World Championships all-around silver medallist put in a flawless display to score 15.600 and strike gold ahead of his Great Britain team-mate Louis Smith.

Olympic pommel horse bronze medal winner Smith, who qualified in first ahead of Keatings, went first in the final and scored 15.375.

Smith was then seen biting his towel as he watched the remaining seven finalists attempt to overhaul his total.

His Huntingdon club-mate Keatings was the penultimate competitor to take to the apparatus and out-scored his compatriot, with Serbia's Saso Bertoncelj claiming bronze with 14.900.

In the floor competition, Germany's Matthias Fahrig won gold, with Greece's Eleftherios Kosmidis taking second and Southport's Daniel Purvis equal third alongside Germany's Marcel Nguyen.

Kosmidis set the standard with a score of 15.400 and Purvis followed up with 15.250 - a mark which was matched by Nguyen.

Wolverhampton's Kristian Thomas managed a 14.975 before Fahrig's stunning 15.650 secured gold in the first individual event on Sunday.
