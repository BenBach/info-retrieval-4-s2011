Cal Crutchlow secured his third World Superbikes pole position of the year ahead of Sterilgarda Yamaha team-mate James Toseland at Kyalami on Saturday.

The two British riders were separated by only 17 hundredths of a second in Superpole, with Crutchlow's time of one minute 37.243 seconds eventually prevailing.

Despite losing out, Toseland took many of the plaudits as he was racing at the South African track for the first time in eight years and is still feeling the after-effects of a heavy crash at Monza a week ago.

Spanish veteran Carlos Checa continued his good season aboard the Althea Ducati by taking third place while Italian Michel Fabrizio rounded out the front row of the grid.

Championship leader Leon Haslam could only manage fifth place but main title rival Max Biaggi was safely behind him in seventh, with Czech rider Jakub Smrz between them.

British Superbike champion Leon Camier will start from eighth with Luca Scassa and Sylvain Guintoli completing the top 10.

Several title hopefuls were near the wrong end of the grid as Jonathan Rea took a disappointing 11th, with Troy Croser and Ruben Xaus 13th and 15th for BMW.

Noriyuki Haga, a multiple race winner and one of the pre-season favourites, continued his awful run of form with 16th place.
