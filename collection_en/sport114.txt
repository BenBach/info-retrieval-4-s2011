Paul Tracy makes his return to racing at the Indianapolis 500 later this month but remains frustrated he cannot secure a ride for a full IndyCar season.

The 41-year-old Canadian is one of the sport's most popular figures, loved by fans for his aggressive attacking style and yet loathed by some fellow drivers for the same reasons.

Tracy, who has 31 wins in the top flight of North American open-wheel racing and who almost won the 500 eight years ago, returns to the Brickyard as part of the KV Racing team.

"It's frustrating when you've been racing as long as I have, your whole life, it's tough to sit and watch the cars go around," Tracy said ahead of the May 30 race.

"It's not for a lack of trying.

"We have multiple people working on trying to find sponsorship for myself and KV (Racing) to operate a car full-time.

"We're turning over every stone, looking around every corner and looking through every bush but it's difficult."
Fierce debate

Tracy will run as part of a four-car team alongside Takuma Sato, E.J. Viso and Mario Moraes and will also be re-united with former boss Barry Green, who masterminded Jacques Villeneuve's 500 win in 1995 and nearly put Tracy in Victory Lane in 2002.

Many race fans remain convinced that he should have won in 2002 ahead of Helio Castroneves, who was awarded the victory when a late-lap caution flag came out just as Tracy was passing the Brazilian to take the lead.

Tracy's team protested the result but the IRL ruled in Castroneves's favour.

"Deep down we know what happened," said Tracy. "This will probably go down in history as one of the most fiercely debated topics for many years."
