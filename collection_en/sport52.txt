England international Ledley King could never see himself playing for anyone other than Tottenham after signing a new contract.

The 29-year-old, who has been named in England's preliminary World Cup squad, is now contracted to the club until the summer of 2012.

King had been out of contact at the end of June although it was unlikely he would leave the White Hart Lane side for pastures new.

The talented defender has spent his entire career with the north Londoners and is delighted to be part of their foreseeable future.
