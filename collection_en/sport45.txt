Roger Federer moved into the third round of the Madrid Masters with a 6-2 7-6 victory over Germany's Benjamin Becker.

The world number one - beaten in straight sets in the Estoril Open semi-finals last week by Alberto Montanes - took just 81 minutes to see off the unseeded Becker.

Becker saved two match points in the 12th game of the second set before the contest went to a tiebreak, where the Swiss defending champion recovered from 3-1 down to win 7-4.

Federer has yet to find his best form on clay this season, with his defence of the French Open title starting in less than a fortnight.

"I served solidly, I returned great and that combination is tough for the opponent," said the 28-year-old, who has failed to reach a final since winning the Australian Open in January.
Celebrations

"I could have made it a bit easier for myself in the second set, I had some chances but that's the sort of stuff I've got to get through and it was important for me to win the break and close it out.

"I've lost many tight matches lately and you try everything out there and just sometimes it's not working the way you want it to work.

"I'm happy with the way I reacted after all the stuff that has happened in the last weeks and months. That's exactly the kind of stuff I need right now in my game."

Last weekend Federer was surprised by Montanes at Estoril in heavy, damp conditions, but the Spaniard's celebrations lasted just a few days as he was beaten on Tuesday by Latvian Ernests Gulbis 7-5 6-1.

Joining Federer in round three is Fernando Verdasco after he battled past Ivo Karlovic 7-6 (7-5) 6-3.

While in round one, Federer's 15th-seeded fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka beat Marcel Granollers of Spain 6-4 6-4.
