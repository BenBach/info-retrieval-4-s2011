Thorpe: No intention to return

Australia's five-time Olympic champion Ian Thorpe has played down speculation regarding a possible comeback at the 2012 London Olympics.

Media reports have speculated the 27-year-old, who announced his retirement from swimming in November 2006, was preparing a return in a bid to win sprint relay gold in London.

But Thorpe, who is currently studying a double university degree in linguistics and psychology, said in a statement on Monday that he had no intention of making a comeback.

In the statement issued through his management company, he said: "I have no intention of returning to competitive swimming.

"My position at the media conference in 2006 announcing the discontinuation of my competitive swimming career has not changed.

"At that conference I said when asked about a return, that it was highly unlikely.

"I really do appreciate the well wishes regarding a possible return to competitive swimming.

"But as I have just said, it's highly unlikely."

Thorpe held 11 world titles and set 13 long-course records before announcing his retirement from swimming after 10 years on the Australian team, saying he had lost the desire to compete.
