Venus Williams eased into the final of the Madrid Open with a 6-3 6-0 victory over Shahar Peer of Israel.

The fourth-seeded American eventually overpowered her opponent after struggling in the first set, breaking for a 3-1 lead before Peer immediately hit back.

However, Williams got her heavy serve working to good effect and broke again to take the set before rushing through the next, clinching the win in just over an hour and six minutes.

It was a disappointing end for Peer, who upset Russian fifth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova in the opening round.

"We exchanged a couple of breaks, she's a really tenacious player," said Williams. "She's very talented, with a never-say-die spirit.

"I was ready for that, and after those (early) games I just seemed to be able to find the corners. I can't complain about being able to play that well against a player like her.

"I've played so many different players with so many different styles - some play more clay-court tennis, others just hit the ball really hard.

"So just to come out on top so far is good, and I'm happy with my form and I'm going to try to keep that form tomorrow."

Aravane Rezai of France awaits in the final, after the world number 24 benefitted from the retirement of Lucie Safarova in the second semi-final.

Rezai raced through the first set 6-1, firing four aces, before the Czech cried enough after only 24 minutes on court.
