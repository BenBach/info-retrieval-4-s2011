Bolt: Sticking with sprints

    If it takes that for me to become a legend in the sport I guess I will but otherwise I wouldn't want to do it.

Usain Bolt
Quotes of the week

Usain Bolt has revealed he will only step up to the 400metres if it is vital to him becoming an athletics legend.

The 100m and 200m Olympic and world champion and world record holder instead wants to focus on continuing his dominance in those two events.

"I think the 200 is as far as I will go," said Bolt.

"I don't want to do 400m. A lot of people want me to but I don't want to do it. But if I have to do it I guess I will do it.

"If it takes that for me to become a legend in the sport I guess I will but otherwise I wouldn't want to do it."

Jamaican Bolt, who is yet to decide whether he will compete at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October, intends to defend his Olympic titles at the 2012 London Games.
Defence

"I definitely want to defend my titles," he said. "A lot of people have just won one title. I think defending that title is very important.

"For me, if you continue dominating over the years you can become one of the greatest ever.

"If I can dominate four, five, six years over the 100metres then I can make myself a legend."
