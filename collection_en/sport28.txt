McCullough fighting at York Hall in 2002

    I'm sure there'll be some ring rust but I can't think about that. I'm just going to come out with all guns blazing.

Wayne McCullough intends on proving age is no barrier when he competes in Prizefighter Super-Bantamweights at York Hall on May 29, which will be broadcast exclusively live on Sky Sports HD1.

The 39-year-old boxing legend, a former WBC world champion at bantamweight who also fought for world titles at two other weights, will be the bookmakers' favourite to win it.

However, favourites do not always win Prizefighter, as former WBO Heavyweight Champion Herbie Hide found out when he had to withdraw at the semi-final stage in Prizefighter Cruiserweights II last month.

"I jumped at the chance to box in Prizefighter knowing the exposure and opportunity it has given the fighters who have taken part in the past," said McCullough.

"A lot of people think I'm done, so I don't think there is any pressure on me.

"I'm sure there'll be some ring rust but I can't think about that. I'm just going to come out with all guns blazing."
Mix of prospects and veterans

Once again, the rest of the entrants include a mix of seasoned veterans and talented prospects looking for a career-changing night.

Nottinghamshire-based Esham Pickering has previously held the European, British and Commonwealth belts, while Liverpool's Mark Moran fought for the British title.

There are two undefeated fighters among the eight. Welshman Ricky Owen has fought 11 times, while St Helens' Craig Lyon had boxed 10 times as a professional.

Aberdeen-born Gavin Reid has fought for the Scottish title, Josh Wale of Barnsley has challenged for the English crown and Middlesbrough's Chris Riley is a former England junior international.
