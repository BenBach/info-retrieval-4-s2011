Dragons roar past Wildcats

    It's a hard lesson learned. We didn't put in the performance expected.

Glasgow Wildcats were consigned to their third successive Co-operative Netball Superleague defeat as Celtic Dragons secured a 48-30 road victory on Monday.

It was a tight contest early on, with just one goal between the sides at the end of the first quarter, although it was the Dragons who had already slipped ahead.

Becky Neate and Cara-lea Mosley produced a solid attack for the visitors from the off, returning 85% success and 77% success respectively overall.
Struggle

The Wildcats struggled to make as much of an impact under the posts as Dragons repeatedly denied the home side their chances.

The clash marked the Scottish side's third game in four days, and the demanding schedule appeared to be taking its toll on the players.

Glasgow skipper Lesley McDonald, who has been nursing an ankle injury, was brought back to the bench in the third quarter as Wildcats tried their luck with all four shooters - to no avail.

Wildcats head coach Denise Holland admits her team were outclassed by the Welsh side, who remained unfazed throughout.

"It's a hard lesson learned. We didn't put in the performance expected," said Holland.

"All credit to Celtic Dragons who kept composed under pressure."
