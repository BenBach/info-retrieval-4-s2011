Robert Kubica impressed in final practice on Saturday morning ahead of qualifying in Monaco, but Thursday's leading man, Fernando Alonso, put it in the barriers.

A difficult session on a dirty track saw a numbered of yellow flag incidents, the main one belonging to Alonso, who put his car into the P1 slot and then the barriers, causing major damage to the right side of his F10.

His departure from the session opened the door for others to step up with Kubica ending Practice Three with a 1:14.806, just 0.046s quicker than Felipe Massa.

Third place went to Mark Webber in a session that saw the top five separated by less than a quarter of a second and the top 12 by less than a full second.

Jaime Alguersuari set the first time of the morning, clocking a 1:19.939 before he was beaten by Michael Schumacher, the Mercedes GP driver shaving a full second off the Toro Rosso driver's time.

Sebastian Vettel slotted in to third place before Alguersuari overhauled Schumacher. Early issues for Timo Gock, who can't quite figure where the track lies and which way to go! Kamui Kobayashi and Pedro de la Rosa moved ahead of Vettel while Alguersuari lowered the benchmark to a 1:17.529.

Vettel improved to first place but was overhauled moments later by Thursday's pace-setter Fernando Alonso, the Spaniard posting a 1:16.266. His team-mate Felipe Massa took fifth place on his first run before being dropped as Sebastien Buemi moved up to third. Massa went on to climb to second, Mark Webber P5 and Jenson Button 11th.
Yellow flags

Yellow flags were out 20 minutes into the session as Alonso stopped by the Hotel de Paris, just before Casino Square. Heavy damage to the front right of the Spaniard's Ferrari, which lost one of its wheels.

Thankfully, Robert Kubica, who was behind Alonso on the track, managed to avoid the runaway wheel. That's really bad news for Alonso as his car most probably won't reach the pits until after the session is completed due to the nature of the track. And that means his Ferrari team will have very little time in which to repair the car before qualifying.

Kubica took the P1 slot, 0.202s ahead of Alonso while Button improved to fourth place and his team-mate Lewis Hamilton P7. Another improvement from Kubica, who took a further two-tenths off the P1 time. Hamilton was the next to lead the way, a 1:15.821 for the 2008 World Champ.

Schumacher brought out the yellow flags as the rear end of his Merc stepped out on him. The German, though, was able to keep his car out of the barriers, put it in reverse and continued on his way. Minutes later Vitaly Petrov pulled off the exact same move, also at Mirabeau. Alonso walked down the pit lane. "I lost my car" he said, asked if it was driver error, he added: "Yeah."

Fourth incident of the session belonged to Adrian Sutil, who lost control at Casino Square, putting his car into a backward slide and slapping his rear wing against the barriers. The Force India driver returned to the pits.

Vettel climbed to second place, 0.060s off Kubica's P1 time. Hamilton went third, Rosberg fourth and Schumacher fifth. Rosberg continued lapping, taking second place, 0.012s slower than Kubica while Webber went fourth.

Great lap

Webber put an end to Kubica's reign, 0.294s up on the Renault driver with Buemi putting in another great lap to take fourth place off Hamilton. Massa had his second big incident - but like the first he just manages to avoid planting his car into the barriers at Rasscasse.

A bit of traffic in the final five minutes, Massa almost called a pile-up, overtaking another car only to then brake, causing those behind to all have to brake. Silly move from the Ferrari driver.

The session ended with Kubica quickest ahead of Massa, Webber, Hamilton, Vettel, Schumacher, Rosberg and Buemi.
