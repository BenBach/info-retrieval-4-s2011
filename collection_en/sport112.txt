Stuart Easton and Michael Laverty shared the spoils in round three of the MCE Insurance British Superbike Championship at Oulton Park on Monday.

Flying Scot Easton led throughout the opener, run in the dry, to take his first win of the season before Laverty scored his maiden victory in a damp second race.

Easton held off a determined charge from championship leader Tommy Hill, his victory margin being just 0.058 seconds.

"It was hard work all of the way, but a great feeling," said Easton, whose progress in race two was halted early on by an electronics problem.

Laverty, meanwhile, forged clear on his Relentless Suzuki in race two and comfortably held off the Ducati of Michael Rutter as Hill maintained his consistent finishing record to come home third.

The results mean that the Worx Suzuki rider now leads the standings with 125 points to Easton's 76.

Meanwhile, Michael's elder brother John enjoyed his best ever finish, taking third in the opener for Buildbase Kawasaki before following that up with a fifth place.
