Isinbayeva: Taking a break

Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva is to take an indefinite break from competition.

The world record holder had hinted that she may take a rest from competition after failing to medal at the world indoor championships in Doha last month and she confirmed her decision on Saturday.

The Doha disappointment was the second World Championship in which Isinbayeva, who struck gold at the last two Olympics, had failed to win.

The Russian said in a statement: "I have been thinking over this very carefully the last three weeks and now come to the conclusion that a break from competing is absolutely necessary for me.

"After more than eight years of very hard training and competing at the highest levels both indoors and outdoors each year I need to step back in order for my body to properly recover.

"It is my full intention to continue training and keep myself fit. At this moment I cannot exactly say when I will return to competitions."

The three-time outdoor world champion and four-time world indoor champion added: "I have not completely ruled out the entire summer circuit or the European Championships in Barcelona.

"Nothing has changed with my long term goals which includes the 2011 and 2013 World Championships and the Olympic Gold in London 2012."
