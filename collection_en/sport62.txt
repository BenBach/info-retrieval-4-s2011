Jérôme Pineau claimed a surprise victory on stage five of the Giro d'Italia after himself and two other early breakaway riders hung on against the odds to take the podium positions.

The relatively flat 168km stage from Novara to Novi Ligure had looked destined to end in a bunch sprint but the peloton mistimed their chase by just four seconds leaving the Quick-Step rider to edge out Julien Fouchard (Cofidis) and Yukiya Arashiro (Bbox-Bouygues) at the line.

Team Sky's Greg Henderson was left pondering what might have been after finishing second best of the rest behind Garmin's Tyler Farrar - although the New Zealander's second top-five finish of the tour reaffirmed his credentials as one of the race's strongest sprinters.

There were no significant changes in the battle for the general classification meaning Vincenzo Nibali maintained his 13-second advantage over Liquigas team-mate Ivan Basso.

Pineau's victory had seemed so unlikely because the Frenchman had forged ahead of the pack with Fouchard, Arashiro and mountain classification leader Paul Voß (Milram) within minutes of the start.

The quartet's lead had peaked at five minutes and 40 seconds early on but had fallen to just over two minutes when Voß dropped back, 20km from home, after taking maximum points on the day's two classified climbs.

Undeterred, that trio pressed on and confusion in the chase pack ultimately worked to their advantage as they were still 50m ahead of their pursuers as they rounded the final corner and onto the closing straight.

Arashiro was first to kick for the line but the Japanese rider ran out of gas moments too early, allowing Pineau to emerge from his shadow and power onwards to victory.

Henderson ended the stage just four seconds off the pace with fellow Team Sky riders Chris Sutton (76th), Dario Cioni (80th), Michael Barry (95th), Bradley Wiggins (98th) and Morris Possoni (130th) all credited with the same time.
