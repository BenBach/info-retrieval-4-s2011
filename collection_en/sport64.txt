British sprinter Mark Cavendish has issued a public apology for the two-fingered salute which accompanied his second win of the season at the Tour de Romandie on Thursday.

The 24-year-old from the Isle of Man, a 10-time Tour de France stage winner, has endured a slow start to the campaign following off-season dental problems.

As he crossed the line in Fribourg, Switzerland, Cavendish made the gesture which he later justified by saying: "I did it really to say I'm back."

However, the HTC-Columbia rider issued a statement the following day which read: "I want to publicly apologise for the gesture I made on the finish line of the Tour de Romandie yesterday.

"I did want to make a statement to my critics but I realise that making a rude gesture on the finish line is not the best way to do that.

"I apologise to everybody watching the race and especially the kids. I am not proud of releasing the feelings in that way.

"I hope I can redeem myself and show my feelings and passion for cycling with some exciting results in the next couple of months rather than with gestures such as the one yesterday."
