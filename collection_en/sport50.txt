Mikhail Youzhny and Marin Cilic progressed to the final of the BMW Open in Munich after semi-final victories over Philipp Petzschner and Marcos Baghdatis respectively.

It will be Youzhny's third straight final appearance at the event, although the Russian will be keen to notch a first victory having fallen at the final hurdle for the past two years.

He was beaten by Philipp Kohlschreiber in 2007 and came up short against Czech Tomas Berdych last time around at the clay-court tournament.

Although he saw off Petzschner in straight sets, he was pushed hard by the German before eventually completing a 7-5 7-6 (7-5) success.

Petzschner, ranked 45 in the world, twice led by a break in the first set but Youzhny recovered immediately on each occasion before breaking again in the 11th game as he moved a set ahead.

Neither player was able to force a break in the second and it was Youzhny who held his nerve in the tie-break to advance.
Cilic fights back

Cilic was forced to come from a set down before getting the better of Baghdatis, ultimately claiming a 3-6 6-2 6-3 win.

The Cypriot was eventually made to pay for a succession of missed opportunities as he converted only one of nine break points.

As the contest wore on, the power of Cilic began to tell and the Croat sealed victory in two and a quarter hours.
