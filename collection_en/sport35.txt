Fernando Alonso has been forced to start Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix from the pit lane after damaging his Ferrari in Saturday practice.

The Spaniard was quickest during the two sessions on Thursday but slid into the barriers midway through Saturday morning running.

Alonso admitted that driver error was the cause of the incident as he lost control on the run-up to Casino Square and smashed the right side of his car against the unforgiving Monaco armco.

The Ferrari mechanics faced a race against time to repair the machine in time for qualifying but damage to the chassis ruled out any chance of making the deadline.

"He's not doing qualifying and will start (the race) from the pit lane," a Ferrari spokesman confirmed.

"The damage is too excessive and we need to change the chassis, which we cannot do in two hours."
