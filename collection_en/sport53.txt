Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck insists owner Roman Abramovich is committed to the club and sees him staying 'indefinitely'.

The Blues have enjoyed a season to remember with Saturday's FA Cup success over Portsmouth securing their first ever Double.

Buck insists Abramovich was basking in the glory of their historic success on Saturday night and that the Russian has never hinted at selling up.
Indefinitely

"He was a very happy man last night (Saturday night)," he said. "I see him here indefinitely.

"He has never, ever given us any indication that he is anything other than a long term Chelsea fan."

According to Buck, any suggestions that Abramovich would sell Chelsea are "totally inaccurate" and "not something that goes through his head".

Buck also revealed that three or four players would be leaving the club in the summer, with three or four new signings to replace them.

He would not be drawn on specific players who could leave the club, such as Joe Cole. But he said the goals and targets were to "keep winning trophies in an efficient business-like manner".
