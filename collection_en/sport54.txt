Wigan Athletic defender Gary Caldwell will miss the start of next season after being told he needed double hip surgery.

The former Celtic stopper underwent an operation on his left hip last week and will return in two months for the same procedure on his right hip.

The 28-year-old will definitely be on the sidelines for the next 12 weeks, although the period could last anything up to five months.

The news will also be a blow for Scotland boss Craig Levein as Caldwell will now miss their opening two Euro 2012 qualifiers.

Caldwell is hoping to be fit for Latics boss Roberto Martinez in October and be ready for international duty to face Czech Republic and Spain.
Three to five months

"Experts say I'll be out for between three and five months," he told the News of the World.

"Hopefully, the right hip won't be as bad as the left hip and I can push towards being out for just three months.

"It all depends on how quickly my body heals. I will definitely miss the start of the season with Wigan as well as Scotland's friendly against Sweden in August.

"I'll also miss our opening two European Championship qualifiers against Lithuania and Liechtenstein at the start of September.

"It will be touch and go for our next double header away to the Czech Republic and at home to Spain in October.

"I'm hoping to be back playing for Wigan by then, so who knows? If I hit the ground running I might just be in contention for those crucial two qualifiers.

"It's not an ideal start to the new season but I thought it was better to get the work done during the summer so I could finally put my hip problems behind me after a frustrating year."
