Andre Fabre picked up his fifth Poule D'Essai Des Poulains when Lope De Vega foiled British raider Dick Turpin at Longchamp.

Maxime Guyon brought the son of Shamardal with a late run to hit the front in the final furlong and hold the determined challenge of Richard Hannon's runner, who filled the same position as at Newmarket two weeks ago.

Classic Colori and Meezaan made brief bids for glory until the two principals took charge.

Dick Turpin had a clear run but was unable to cope with the finishing kick from the winner, who was always holding Richard Hughes' mount.

"The horse never stopped and they went a very good pace," said Guyon. "He is certainly a very good horse and he might stay the distance of the Prix du Jockey-Club (10 furlongs)."

Connections of Dick Turpin were delighted with his run and a trip to Royal Ascot is now on the agenda.

Richard Hannon jnr, the trainer's son and assistant, said: "He's run a super race and has now finished second in two Guineas.

"He's an exceptionally good horse but there are no excuses and we will now go and take our chance in the St James's Palace."

Shamalgan was third while hot favourite Siyouni got no sort of run in the straight and came home a long way back.
