Quarterback JaMarcus Russell's days in Oakland are over after the Raiders released the former number one overall draft pick.

Russell was taken with the opening selection in the entry draft three years ago, signing a six-year deal that included $32 million in guaranteed money.

However the 24-year-old has never hit the same heights in the NFL that he managed during his college career at Louisiana State University.

In 25 games, Russell lead the franchise to just seven victories. He completed 52.1 percent of his passes, managing 18 touchdowns to 23 interceptions.

The decision to cut him comes as no surprise after the Raiders acquired quarterback Jason Campbell in a trade with the Washington Redskins.

Oakland also have Bruce Gradkowski, who is currently recovering from off-season surgery to repair a torn pectoral muscle, Charlie Frye and Kyle Boller on their roster.
